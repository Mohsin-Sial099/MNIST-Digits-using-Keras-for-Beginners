## Overview
This notebook walks through the process of:
- Importing and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
- Building a simple neural network using Keras.
- Training and evaluating the model.
- Visualizing results and model performance.

The goal is to achieve accurate classification of handwritten digits (0-9) using a straightforward approach, making it accessible for those new to machine learning and neural networks.

## Dataset
The [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of 28x28 grayscale digits. Each image is labeled with a digit from 0 to 9.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook installed
- Basic understanding of Python and machine learning concepts

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Install the required dependencies (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)).
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the notebook.
4. Run each cell sequentially to execute the code.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Normalizes the MNIST dataset for efficient training.
- **Model Building:** Uses Keras to define a simple neural network architecture.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Trains the model on the training set and evaluates it on the test set.
- **Visualization:** Includes visualizations of sample predictions and model accuracy/loss graphs.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow` (or `keras`)

Install them using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow
```

## Acknowledgements
The MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset widely used in the machine learning community. Thanks to Yann LeCun and collaborators for making it available.
